Build an expert system for diagnosing common car issues based on symptoms using Prolog. The system will identify potential issues with a car by asking about specific symptoms (e.g., car not starting, engine noise, etc.) and determining the most likely cause.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a Prolog-based expert system that can diagnose common car problems based on symptoms such as the car not starting, abnormal noises, or warning lights. The system should query the user for symptoms and provide a likely diagnosis.

### Car Issues and Symptoms
Each car problem has associated symptoms: 1. Dead Battery
o Symptoms: Car won&#39;t start, headlights dim or off, clicking noise when starting. 2. Flat Tire
o Symptoms: Car pulling to one side, tire pressure warning light on, visible tire damage.
3. Engine Overheating
o Symptoms: High temperature gauge, steam from the hood, engine overheating warning light.
4. Brake Failure
o Symptoms: Soft brake pedal, car not stopping properly, brake warning light on.

After defining the rules and querying the system, extend this into a decision tree for more complex or interactive diagnosis. Draw the full decision tree starting from the car not starting, branching into further symptoms until you reach diagnoses such as a dead battery, flat tire, engine overheating, or brake failure.
